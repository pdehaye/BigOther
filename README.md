# BigOther

EU and Swiss data protection laws allow individuals to access their personal data.

This project aims to request this data from many companies, and collect all that information centrally. 

The main interest is not so much in the data "reclaimed", but in the process, its quirks and difficulty.

The title is a reference to Shoshana Zuboff's paper ["Big Other: Surveillance Capitalism and the Prospects of an Information Civilization"](http://www.shoshanazuboff.com/new/recent-publications-and-interviews/big-other-surveillance-capitalism-and-the-prospects-of-an-information-civilization/).
