EU and Swiss data protection laws allow individuals to access their personal data. 

This is the result of doing such a request with Uber. 

Data file
=========

The data is contained in one file called `uber-edited.xlsx`, a workbook spanning several sheets. Apologies for using a proprietary format, but this is what I was given by Uber, with all the weird formatting. I also exported this into HTML, see `uber-edited.htm`. 


Data removed
============

For privacy reasons, Uber removed some of the data prior to sending over the rest. This includes, for instance, the name of my drivers. I myself edited some of the data so I could share it more widely. This includes, for instance, information related to my credit card. 

AAA: email
BBB: phone
CCC: ?????
DDD: last 4 digit credit card, bank, expiration date
EEEEEEEE-EEEE-EEEE-EEEE-EEEEEEEEEEEE: Advertiser ID
FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFFFF: Uber ID

History of the request
======================

I made a first request, by email, in July 2015. It was addressed to the Uber headquarters in the US, who punted to their European HQ in the Netherlands, but I never heard back from them. I tried to get the Dutch data protection authority to investigate on the topic, but they declined. 

On April 25th 2016, I filed again, this time by certified mail directly addressed in the Netherlands, which finally prompted a response from Uber NL. You can see the course of the exchange in the letters/ folder.
